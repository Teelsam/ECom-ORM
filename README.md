## Description 

Here we have an application that is used to explore ORM fundamentals. ORM stands for Object Relation Mapping. Here we mix and interact with databases through a package called Sequelize. ORM is a way to use Object Oriented Programming and databases together. We set up some models/objects which we can then  use as tables layouts for a databases content. 

## Usage

Install the npm packages and using alongside insomnia and sql workbench you can seed the tables with `node seeds/index.js` and then run CRUD operations on that data.
